# SMSarchiver
JavaFX application that converts text conversation in xml into html

## Getting Started
The code was written in Eclipse IDE on a machine running Windows 10 operating system. Download Main.java and run it as shown below. 

![usage demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dRadovan/SMSarchiver/master/images/smsarchiver_anim.gif)

Make sure that the CSS file (constyle.css) is in the same folder as the output html file (convOutput.html) so that conversation bubbles may be displayed properly.
Sample include a few lines of text exchange between the two parties. Each text is saved as a line in the xml/txt file in the following format: 	

```xml
<sms address="+11111111111" time="Aug 30, 2017 13:20:10" date="1504092010364" type="1" body="Hi, how are you doing?" read="1" service_center="+22222222222" name="Some Friend" />
```
